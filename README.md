FractionCalculator.java Write a program that lets the user type in a simple math problem involving fractions, as shown in the examples below. The program evaluates the expression and prints the result. Your program must be able to handle addition subtraction, multiplication and division of fractions. Use the Rational class from Chapter 13 to represent the fractions. You will need to use the split method in the String class to retrieve the numerator string and denominator string, and convert strings into integers using the Integer.parseInt method. Assume that the input is always formatted as below, as far as spacing is concerned. You do not need to check for invalid input.
